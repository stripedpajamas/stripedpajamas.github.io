## Excerpt from _History_ by Emerson

The world exists for the education of each man.
There is no age or state of society or mode of action in history,
to which there is not somewhat corresponding in his life.
Every thing tends in a wonderful manner to abbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him.
He should see that he can live all history in his own person.
He must sit solidly at home, and not suffer himself to be bullied by kings or empires,
but know that he is greater than all the geography and all the government of the world;
he must transfer the point of view from which history is commonly read,
from Rome and Athens and London to himself, and not deny his conviction that he is the court,
and if England or Egypt have any thing to say to him, he will try the case;
if not, let them for ever be silent.
He must attain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield their secret sense,
and poetry and annals are alike. The instinct of the mind, the purpose of nature, betrays itself
in the use we make of the signal narrations of history. Time dissipates to shining ether the
solid angularity of facts. No anchor, no cable, no fences, avail to keep a fact a fact. Babylon,
Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome, are passing already into fiction. The Garden of Eden,
the sun standing still in Gibeon, is poetry thenceforward to all nations.
Who cares what the fact was, when we have made a constellation of it to hang in heaven an
immortal sign? London and Paris and New York must go the same way.
"What is History," said Napoleon, "but a fable agreed upon?"
This life of ours is stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul, England, War, Colonization,
Church, Court, and Commerce, as with so many flowers and wild ornaments grave and gay.
I will not make more account of them. I believe in Eternity.
I can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain, and the Islands,--the genius and creative principle
of each and of all eras in my own mind.
