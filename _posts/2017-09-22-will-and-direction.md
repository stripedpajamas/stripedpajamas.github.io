## Will and Direction

Start here with the Twelve & Twelve:

> [...] This statement may surprise newcomers who have experienced nothing but constant deflation
> and a growing conviction that <span class="post-highlight">human will is of no value whatever</span>. 
> They have become persuaded, and rightly so, that many problems besides alcohol will not yield to a
> headlong assault powered by the individual alone. But now it appears there are certain things which only the
> individual can do. All by himself, and in the light of his own circumstances, he needs to develop the quality
> of willingness. When he acquires willingness, he is the only one who can make the decision to exert himself. Trying to 
> do this is an act of his own will. All of the Twelve Steps require sustained and personal exertion to 
> conform to their principles and so, we trust, to God's will.
>   
> <span class="post-highlight">It is when we try to use our will to conform to God's that we begin to use it rightly.</span>
> To all of us, this was a most wonderful revelation. Our whole trouble had been the misuse of willpower. We had tried
> to bombard our problems with it instead of attempting to <span class="post-highlight">bring it into agreement with God's
> intention for us.</span> To make this increasingly possible is the purpose of A.A.'s Twelve Steps, and Step Three opens the 
> door.

Which sounds a lot like Rabban Gamliel in Pirkei Avos: 

> He would also say: <span class="post-highlight">Make that His will should be your will,</span>
> so that He should make your will to be as His will.
> Nullify your will before His will, so that He should nullify the will of others before your will.

And Jesus says in Matthew 7:

> Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven,
> but the one <span class="post-highlight">who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span>

In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna tries to explain to Arjuna what it means to act properly and his conclusion
is stark and sacred:

> | This is how actions were done  
> | by the ancient seekers of freedom;    
> | follow their example: act,  
> | surrendering the fruits of action.  
> |  
> | What are action and inaction?  
> | This matter confuses even  
> | wise men; so I will teach you  
> | and free you from any harm.  
> |  
> | You must realize what action is,  
> | what wrong action and inaction are  
> | as well. The true nature of action  
> | is profound and difficult to fathom.  
> |  
> | He who can see inaction  
> | in the midst of action, and  
> | action in the midst of inaction, is wise  
> | and can act in the spirit of yoga.  
> |  
> | With no desire for success,
> | no anxiety about failure,  
> | indifferent to results, he burns up  
> | his actions in the fire of wisdom.  
> |  
> | <span class="post-highlight">Surrendering all thoughts of outcome,  </span>
> | unperturbed, self-reliant,  
> | he does nothing at all, even  
> | when fully engaged in actions.  
> |  
> | There is nothing that he expects,  
> | nothing that he fears. Serene,  
> | free from possessions, untainted,  
> | action with the body alone,  
> |  
> | content with whatever happens,  
> | unattached to pleasure or pain,  
> | success or failure, he acts  
> | and is never bound by his action.  
> |  
> | When a man has let go of attachments,  
> | when his mind is rooted in wisdom,  
> | <span class="post-highlight">everything he does is worship  </span>
> | and his actions all melt away.  
> |  
> | <span class="post-highlight">God is the offering, God  </span>
> | <span class="post-highlight">is the offered, poured out by God;  </span>
> | <span class="post-highlight">God is attained by all those  </span>
> | <span class="post-highlight">who see God in every action.  </span> 

Like a kind of emptying of self, becoming a channel for the divine. So we end with Emerson:

> This insight, which expresses itself by what is called Imagination, is a very high sort of seeing,
> which does not come by study, but by the intellect being where and what it sees, by sharing the path,
> or circuit of things through forms, and making them translucid to others. The path of things is silent.
> Will they suffer a speaker to go with them? A spy they will not suffer; a lover, a poet,
> is the transcendency of their own nature,—him they will suffer. The condition of true naming,
> on the poet’s part, is his <span class="post-highlight">resigning himself to the divine aura which
> breathes through forms, and accompanying that.</span>
>  
> It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns, that, beyond the energy of his
> possessed and conscious intellect, he is capable of a new energy (as of an intellect doubled on
> itself), <span class="post-highlight">by abandonment to the nature of things; </span>
> that, beside his privacy of power as an individual man, <span class="post-highlight">there is a
> great public power, on which he can draw, by unlocking, at all risks, his human doors, and
> suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him:</span> then he is
> caught up into the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder, his thought is law, and his words
> are universally intelligible as the plants and animals. The poet knows that he speaks adequately,
> then, only when he speaks somewhat wildly, or, “with the flower of the mind”; not with the
> intellect, used as an organ, but with the intellect released from all service, and suffered to
> <span class="post-highlight">take its direction from its celestial life;</span> or, as the
> ancients were wont to express themselves, not with intellect alone, but with the intellect
> inebriated by nectar. As the traveller who has lost his way, throws his reins on his horse’s neck,
> and trusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do with the divine
> animal who carries us through this world. For if in any manner we can stimulate this instinct,
> new passages are opened for us into nature, the mind flows into and through things hardest and
> highest, and the metamorphosis is possible.
