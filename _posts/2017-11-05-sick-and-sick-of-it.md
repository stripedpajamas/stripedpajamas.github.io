## sick
day 1 is hell. it might be where hell came from. it is pain without meaning. not even pain I guess, just an unavoidable discomfort. it feels like your body is emptying itself of all liquids through the nose. it feels like your body is stupid on day 1. like it doesn't know how to be good at being a body. and all the drugs you take on day 1 don't help on day 1. all the vitamins and the tea and the sleep and the denial and you still can't avoid it. it's disgusting and it makes me angry.

day 2 is purgatory. it might be where purgatory came from. it hurts but it's productive. you cough and something comes up. you blow your nose and there are colors in the tissue. it's disgusting, but encouraging. like maybe this all has meaning. your body doesn't feel stupid anymore. now it just feels weak. drugs work but you almost don't want them anymore because the pain is a good pain. you take them anyway because it's still pain and no pain is good pain.

day 3 is heaven, and by heaven i mean earth. it's back to normal and now normal feels special.
